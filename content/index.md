## Heading Level 2

Here is some **bold text**

Here is some _italic text_

**Link markdown template in markdown**:
* [[Exact Title of Page on WAI website]](/permalink/to/page/)
* [WAI website but not exact title](/permalink/to/page/)
* [link off WAI website](https://example.com)

Description of link markdown:
* When the linked text is the **exact same as the title of the page** on the WAI website, use **double brackets** and permalink, e.g.:<br>
    ```[[W3C Accessibility Standards Overview]](/standards-guidelines/)```<br>
  In GitHub rich text, it will have an extra bracket. You can ignore that.
* When linked text is not the title of the page and goes to WAI website, use single brackets and permalink, e.g.:<br>
    ```[about our standards](/standards-guidelines/)```
* When it links off the WAI website, use single brackets and full URI, e.g.:<br>
   ``` [ISO standards](https://example.com) ```
